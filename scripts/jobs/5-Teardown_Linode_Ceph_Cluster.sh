# this script implements the Jenkins job by the same name,
# just call it in the "Execute shell" field 
# in the job configuration
# because bash doesn't throw exceptions, 
# the script doesn't stop automatically because of a 
# fatal error, we have to check for errors and exit 
# with an error status if one is seen, 
# Jenkins will stop the pipeline immediately,
# this makes troubleshooting a pipeline much easier for the user
